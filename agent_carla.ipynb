    "#### Environment Setup\n",
    "- CARLA Client & World:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### TD Learning & Actor-Critic Methods\n",
    "- TD Error:  \n",
    "  - The difference between the bootstrapped multi-step return and the current value estimate.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Step Return Calculation:  \n",
    "  - Uses backward induction to compute returns for each time step.\n",
    "  - We compute the multi-step return $R_t$ for a rollout of length $n$ using: $\\\\ $ $R_t = r_t + \\gamma r_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \\ldots + \\gamma^{n-1}r_{t+n-1} + \\gamma^n V(s_{t+n})$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A\\* Search: \n",
    "  - Implements global path planning on a grid.\n",
    "  - Uses the Euclidean distance as a heuristic to guide the search: $\\\\ $ $h(n) = ||n - \\text{ goal}||$\n",
    "    - $h(n)$ is a heuristic estimate of the cost from node $n$ to the goal.\n",

    "  - Used in conjunction with A\\* search for global route planning (currently commented out or not actively used).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, this Python script does:\n",
    "- It initializes a CARLA client, spawns vehicles, NPCs, and pedestrians, and attaches sensors to the agent's vehicle.\n",
    "- An Actor–Critic network (A3C) processes camera images to output control commands. This network is trained via reinforcement learning using TD learning and multi-step returns.\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning Framework: The agent learns through rollouts where it collects transitions (state, action, reward, etc.) and then updates its policy using a combination of policy gradients and value function updates. It uses prioritized experience replay to sample important transitions more frequently.\n",
    "- The code includes an A* search algorithm that can compute a global path based on a grid of obstacles. Although LiDAR-based obstacle detection is part of the original plan, that section may or may not be working as intended currently.\n",
    "- The training loop computes evaluation metrics, saves model checkpoints, and plots reward graphs. It includes memory management (like GPU cache clearing and garbage collection) to prevent crashes during extended training."
